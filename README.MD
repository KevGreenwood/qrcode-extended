# xqrcode

Modules to extend the customization capabilities of the `qrcode` library.  
The goal of this project is to unify these two modules into one, allowing for independent customization of the eyes and pupils of a QR code, separate from the rest of its body. Additionally, the unified module will enable the use of different color masks for further flexibility.

## CustomEyeShape

This module allows for changing the shape and colors of the QR code’s eyes independently. However, altering the background color can unintentionally affect other colors within the QR code.

## CustomEyeColor

This module is focused solely on changing the colors of the QR code’s eyes.

### Suggestions for Future Enhancements

- Merge both modules into a single, cohesive solution for easier and more advanced QR code customization.  
- Enable independent customization of eye shapes and colors without affecting the rest of the QR code.  
- Support multiple color masks for added versatility.
